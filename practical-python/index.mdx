## From scripts to programs

You've learned the building blocks. Now let's put them together into organized, maintainable programs.

In this section, you'll learn how real Python projects are structured and how to work with files, organize your code, and build programs that actually do useful things.

## What you'll build

Throughout this section, you'll build a sales analysis project step by step:
1. **Set up a project** - Create organized folder structure
2. **Understand paths** - Learn how Python finds your files
3. **Work with data** - Read CSV files and save as JSON
4. **Organize code** - Split code into reusable functions

By the end, you'll have a complete data analysis program and understand how real Python projects work.
