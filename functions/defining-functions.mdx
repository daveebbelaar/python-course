## Your first function

A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. You define it once, then call it whenever you need that task done.

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")
    print("Welcome to Python!")

# Call the function
greet()
```

## Function syntax

Every function follows this pattern:

```python
def function_name():
    # Code goes here
    # Must be indented
    pass
```

Key parts:
- `def` - keyword that creates a function
- Function name followed by parentheses `()`
- Colon `:` to start the function body
- Indented code block (the function body)

## Naming functions

Follow these rules for function names:
- Use lowercase letters
- Separate words with underscores
- Be descriptive about what it does

```python
# Good names
def calculate_total():
    pass

def send_email():
    pass

def validate_password():
    pass

# Bad names
def func1():  # Not descriptive
    pass

def Calculate():  # Should be lowercase
    pass
```

## Calling functions

To use a function, call it by name with parentheses:

```python
def say_goodbye():
    print("Goodbye!")
    print("See you later!")

# Call it multiple times
say_goodbye()
say_goodbye()
say_goodbye()
```

<Tip>
  The power of functions: write once, use many times. The above code prints 6 lines with just 3 function calls!
</Tip>

## Functions with logic

Functions can contain any Python code:

```python
def check_weather():
    temperature = 25
    if temperature > 30:
        print("It's hot!")
    else:
        print("Nice weather!")

# Use the function
check_weather()
```

## Common mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Forgetting parentheses when calling">
    ```python
    # Wrong - this doesn't call the function
    greet
    
    # Right - parentheses are required
    greet()
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Forgetting the colon">
    ```python
    # Wrong
    def greet()
        print("Hello")
    
    # Right
    def greet():
        print("Hello")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bad indentation">
    ```python
    # Wrong - not indented
    def greet():
    print("Hello")
    
    # Right - must indent function body
    def greet():
        print("Hello")
    ```
  </Accordion>

Functions become powerful when they can accept input. Let's learn about parameters!
