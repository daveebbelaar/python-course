## Building with functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that do specific tasks. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you write it once as a function and call it whenever needed.

Think of functions like:
- A recipe you can follow multiple times
- A machine that takes input and produces output
- A named shortcut for complex operations

## Why use functions?

- **Don't repeat yourself**: Write code once, use it many times
- **Stay organized**: Break complex programs into smaller pieces
- **Fix bugs easier**: Change code in one place, affects everywhere
- **Test your code**: Test each function separately

## Real-world examples

Functions are everywhere in programming:
- `print()` - displays text (built-in function)
- `len()` - counts items (built-in function)
- `calculate_tax()` - your custom function
- `send_email()` - your custom function

## Let's begin!

Start by learning how to create your first function.
