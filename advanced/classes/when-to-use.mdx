## Programming paradigms

Python supports multiple programming styles. The two main ones are:

**Functional programming** - Using functions to transform data:
```python
# Functions operate on data
def clean_text(text):
    return text.strip().lower()

def remove_punctuation(text):
    return text.replace(".", "").replace(",", "")

# Chain functions together
result = remove_punctuation(clean_text("  Hello, World.  "))
```

**Object-oriented programming** - Using classes to bundle data and behavior:
```python
# Class bundles data and methods
class TextProcessor:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text
    
    def clean(self):
        self.text = self.text.strip().lower()
        return self
    
    def remove_punctuation(self):
        self.text = self.text.replace(".", "").replace(",", "")
        return self

# Chain methods on object
processor = TextProcessor(text="  Hello, World.  ")
result = processor.clean().remove_punctuation().text
```

<Note>
  Both approaches achieve the same result! Classes don't unlock new features - they're just a different way to organize your code. Choose based on what makes your code clearer.
</Note>

## When to use classes

**Use classes when you need to:**
- Keep track of state between operations
- Group related data and functions together
- Create multiple instances with similar behavior
- Model real-world objects or concepts

## When to use functions

**Use functions when you have:**
- Simple transformations (input â†’ output)
- Stateless operations
- One-off calculations
- Small scripts

<Tip>
  Start with functions. They're simpler and often sufficient. Only add classes when you find yourself passing the same data between multiple functions or when you need to maintain state.
</Tip>

## Common pitfalls

**Over-engineering**: Don't create classes for simple operations. A class with one method is usually better as a function.

**God objects**: Classes that do too many things. Keep classes focused on a single responsibility.

**Static method classes**: If all methods are static, you probably want a module with functions instead.

## What's next?

Now that you understand classes, let's learn about version control with Git - essential for any developer.
