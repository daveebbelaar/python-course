## The complete Python for AI roadmap

This course teaches you Python specifically for AI development. Not just theory or hobby projects. Real, production-ready skills that companies are paying for right now.

You'll go from zero to building a complete AI agent, all in one course.

## What you'll build

By the end of this course, you'll build a **complete document processing AI agent** that:
- Takes documents and processes them automatically
- Stores data in a vector database
- Powers an interactive chat application
- Uses professional Python development practices
