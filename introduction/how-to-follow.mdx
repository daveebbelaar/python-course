## Two ways to learn

This course exists as both a YouTube video and this handbook. The video walks you through every concept in real-time. This handbook contains everything from the video plus additional details, code snippets, and deeper explanations.

Keep this handbook open while watching. I'll reference specific sections you can jump to, you can copy code directly instead of typing from the video, and you can dive deeper into topics that interest you.

## Adjust to your pace

Going too fast? Pause the video and read the handbook chapter carefully. Use ChatGPT to explain concepts in simpler terms - think of AI as your personal tutor available 24/7. Some concepts need multiple passes, that's normal.

Going too slow? The YouTube video has timestamps for every section, so skip to what you need. Watch at 1.5x or 2x speed. Skim the handbook to decide what to focus on.

## About the code examples

As we progress, you'll see increasingly complex code. The goal isn't to understand every single line immediately - it's exposure to what's possible. We start simple and build complexity over time. Real learning happens when you build your own projects, not just from watching.

If you see a large code example and think "this is too much," that's okay. You're building foundations, and gaps will fill in as you practice.

## Use AI to learn faster

ChatGPT and other AI assistants are incredibly powerful for learning:

```
Example prompts:

"Explain this Python code in simple terms: [paste code]"

"What does this error mean? [paste error message]"

"Show me 3 different ways to solve this problem in Python"
```

## This handbook stays updated

Unlike the video which is fixed, this handbook gets updated regularly. If something doesn't work in the video (outdated syntax, changed tools), check here first. When students find issues, I update these docs so everyone benefits.

## How to approach this course

Watch actively and code along. Make mistakes and fix them. Use the handbook to go deeper and copy code. Ask AI when stuck. After each major section, try building something similar on your own. Accept that you don't need to master everything before moving forward - understanding deepens with practice.
