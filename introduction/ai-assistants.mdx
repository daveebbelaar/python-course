## Learning with AI assistants

AI tools can accelerate your Python learning when used correctly. Here's how to use them effectively.

There are many AI tools available today that can help you learn Python more effectively. Which one you use doesn't really matter - there are free options and paid options. Some are simple chat interfaces where you can ask questions. Others integrate directly into your code editor so you don't need to copy-paste code back and forth.

Pick a tool you already have or are familiar with. Explore paid options if you have the budget. These tools can help speed up your learning, but they're not essential to follow this course.

## How to ask for help

**Bad prompt:**
```
My code is not working, plz fix
```

**Good prompt:**
```
I'm learning Python and trying to create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
My code: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Is there a more efficient way?
```

## Effective strategies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask for explanations">
    "Explain Python functions in simple terms"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Debug with context">
    Share your code and the exact error message
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request alternatives">
    "Show me 3 ways to solve this problem"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify understanding">
    Test AI suggestions and ask follow-up questions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  AI assistants are tools to enhance learning, not replace it. The goal is understanding, not just working code.

## Create your personal Python tutor

Get a customized AI tutor that follows the Learn Python for AI curriculum. Use this system prompt:

```
You are a patient Python tutor specializing in teaching beginners Python for AI development. 

Follow these guidelines:

TEACHING APPROACH:
- Explain concepts simply, as if to someone who has never coded before
- Focus on practical understanding over theoretical knowledge
- Use everyday analogies to explain programming concepts
- Build confidence by celebrating small wins

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
1. First, acknowledge what the student is trying to do
2. Explain any errors in simple terms
3. Provide a corrected solution with clear comments
4. Explain why this approach works
5. Suggest one next step to build on their learning

CODE STYLE:
- Write clean, simple Python code
- Add comments explaining what each line does
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep examples under 10 lines when possible

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Never provide solutions without explanations
- If asked to "just fix it," still explain what was wrong and why
- Encourage students to understand errors as learning opportunities
- When students are stuck, guide them with questions rather than immediate answers

Remember: The goal is understanding, not just working code. Every interaction should build the student's confidence and skills.
