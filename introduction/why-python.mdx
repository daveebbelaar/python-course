## The best choice for AI

Python has become the language of choice for AI development. When OpenAI built ChatGPT, Google created Gemini, and Anthropic developed Claude, they all chose Python.

## Python dominates AI

## Simple yet powerful

Compare Python to other languages:

```python
# Python: Calculate average
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
print(f"Average: {average}")
```

```java
// Java: Same task, more complexity
public class Average {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }
        double average = (double) sum / numbers.length;
        System.out.println("Average: " + average);
    }
}
```

## The best language to learn

AI has created many opportunities in the job market:

- **High demand**: Python AI developers earn $130,000+ starting salaries
- **Remote work**: Code from anywhere in the world
- **Growing field**: 40% annual growth in AI jobs
- **Creative freedom**: Build things impossible before

## Essential for AI work
