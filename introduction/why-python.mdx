## The best choice for AI

Python is the dominant language in AI research and development: OpenAI, Google, Anthropic (and many others) use Python heavily for prototyping, experimentation, and tooling around their LLMs. 

It has also been the backbone of modern machine learning, powering the entire ecosystem of frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and XGBoost â€“ the tools that made deep learning and AI breakthroughs possible in the first place.

## Simple yet powerful

Compare Python to other languages:

```python
# Python: Calculate average
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
print(f"Average: {average}")
```

```java
// Java: Same task, more complexity
public class Average {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }
        double average = (double) sum / numbers.length;
        System.out.println("Average: " + average);
    }
}
```

## The best language to learn

AI has created many opportunities in the job market:

- **High demand**: Python AI developers earn $130,000+ starting salaries
- **Remote work**: Code from anywhere in the world
- **Growing field**: 40% annual growth in AI jobs
- **Creative freedom**: Build things impossible before
