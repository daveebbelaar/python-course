## Who this is for

This course works whether you've never written a line of code or you're coming from another programming language. We start from absolute zero and build up systematically, but move quickly enough that experienced programmers won't get bored.

The key difference: you'll learn Python with professional tools and workflows from day one. Not simplified "beginner" versions you'll have to unlearn later. The same setup used in real companies.

## This course is for you if:

You want to build AI applications and need Python skills to make that happen. You prefer learning by doing rather than spending hours on theory. You're ready to install software, write code, and build real projects.

## This course is NOT for you if:

You want a slow, exhaustive reference covering every Python feature. This course is focused and practical - we teach what you need for AI development, not everything Python can do. If you're looking for casual hobby-level coding without proper tooling, this might feel more structured than you want.
