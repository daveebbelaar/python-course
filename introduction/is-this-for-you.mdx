## Who this is for

This course works for everyone, regardless of experience:

**Complete beginners** - Never written a line of Python? Perfect. We start from absolute zero and build up systematically.

**Career switchers** - Coming from another programming language? You'll appreciate the focused, no-nonsense approach and professional setup.

**AI enthusiasts** - Curious about AI but don't know where to start with Python? This course bridges that gap perfectly.

## This course is for you if...

<Tip>
  **You want to learn what companies actually use**
  
  Learn Python with a professional setup and best practices from day one - the same tools and workflows used in real companies, not simplified "beginner" versions you'll have to unlearn later.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **You want to build AI applications**
  
  You're learning Python specifically to work with AI, build intelligent systems, and stay relevant in the AI-driven future.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **You want practical skills, not just theory**
  
  You want to write code, build projects, and learn by doing - not spend hours on abstract concepts and theory you'll never use in practice.
</Tip>

## This course is NOT for you if...

<Warning>
  **You're looking for casual, hobby-level Python**
  
  You'll learn professional development practices, tools, and workflows used in real companies. If you just want to tinker casually without proper setup, this might be more structured than you need.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **You want a slow, exhaustive reference covering everything**
  
  This course is fast and focused. We cover what you need for AI development, not every Python feature that exists. Depth over breadth - the 20% that gives you 80% of results.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **You expect to learn without writing code**
  
  This is hands-on from day one. You'll need to install software, write code, and build projects. If you're not ready to get your hands dirty, come back when you are.
</Warning>

## Still not sure?
