## Beyond built-in Python

Python comes with many built-in functions, but its real power comes from external packages. These are pre-written code libraries that add new capabilities.

## What are packages really?

Packages are just Python files containing code - typically combinations of functions (which you've learned) and classes (coming later). When you import a package, you're bringing that functionality into your project.

Two types of packages:
- **Built-in**: Come with Python installation (already in your environment)
- **External**: Downloaded from the internet into your virtual environment folder

## Python's ecosystem

Python has packages for everything:
- **Web scraping**: Extract data from websites
- **Data analysis**: Process spreadsheets and databases
- **AI/ML**: Build intelligent applications
- **APIs**: Connect to online services
- **Automation**: Control your computer

## Package examples

Here are packages you'll likely use:
- `requests` - Make web requests
- `pandas` - Work with data tables
- `beautifulsoup4` - Parse HTML
- `openai` - Use AI models
- `python-dotenv` - Manage secrets

<Tip>
  When you need to do something, search "Python package for [task]" and you'll likely find options.
