## Beyond built-in Python

Python comes with many built-in functions, but its real power comes from external packages. These are pre-written code libraries that add new capabilities.

Think of packages like:
- Apps you install on your phone
- Tools you add to your toolbox
- Recipes you download for cooking

## Python's ecosystem

Python has packages for everything:
- **Web scraping**: Extract data from websites
- **Data analysis**: Process spreadsheets and databases
- **AI/ML**: Build intelligent applications
- **APIs**: Connect to online services
- **Automation**: Control your computer

## Package examples

Here are packages you'll likely use:
- `requests` - Make web requests
- `pandas` - Work with data tables
- `beautifulsoup4` - Parse HTML
- `openai` - Use AI models
- `python-dotenv` - Manage secrets

<Tip>
  Don't memorize package names. When you need to do something, search "Python package for [task]" and you'll find options.
