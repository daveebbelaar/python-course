## Never put secrets in your code

When working with APIs or databases, you'll need:
- API keys
- Passwords
- Connection strings

Putting these directly in your code is dangerous - anyone can see them!

## The solution

Environment variables let you keep secrets separate from your code. We'll learn two approaches:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Environment variables"
    icon="gear"
    href="/tools/environment/variables"
  >
    What they are and how they work
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="Using .env files"
    icon="file-shield"
    href="/tools/environment/dotenv"
  >
    The easy way with .env files
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Most Python projects use `.env` files - they're simple and work great for local development.
