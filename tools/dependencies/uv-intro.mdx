## See the difference

Let's install a package with pip vs uv:

### With pip (traditional)
```bash
pip install pandas
# ⏱️ Takes 15-30 seconds
```

### With uv (modern)
```bash
uv pip install pandas
# ⚡ Takes 1-2 seconds
```

That's 10-30x faster! And it gets better.

## Real-world comparison

Creating a new project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Traditional way">
    ```bash
    # Create virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv
    
    # Activate it (different per OS!)
    # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    # Mac/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install packages
    pip install requests pandas numpy
    
    # Save dependencies
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    
    **Time**: ~45 seconds
    **Commands**: 4+ (varies by OS)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="With uv">
    ```bash
    # Everything in one command
    uv init
    uv add requests pandas numpy
    ```
    
    **Time**: ~3 seconds
    **Commands**: 2
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Why is uv so fast?

1. **Written in Rust** - Compiled language, not interpreted Python
2. **Smart caching** - Reuses downloaded files intelligently
3. **Parallel downloads** - Gets multiple packages at once
4. **Better algorithms** - Optimized dependency resolution

## More than just speed

### One tool, not five

Traditional Python:
- `pip` for packages
- `venv` for virtual environments
- `pip-compile` for lock files
- `pyenv` for Python versions
- `pipx` for global tools

With uv:
- `uv` does it all

### It just works

No more:
- "Did I activate my venv?"
- "Which Python am I using?"
- "Why is this package conflicting?"

uv handles it automatically.

### Modern features

- **Lock files** - Exact reproducible installs
- **Workspace support** - Multiple related projects
- **Script running** - Built-in task runner
- **Python management** - Install Python versions too

## Installing uv

One command for any system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mac/Linux">
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After installation, restart your terminal.

## Quick commands

Here's what you need to know:

```bash
# Create new project
uv init my-project

# Add packages
uv add requests pandas

# Install from existing project
uv sync

# Run Python
uv run python script.py
```

## Should you switch?

**Yes, if you want:**
- Faster development
- Simpler commands
- Less confusion
- Modern tooling

**Maybe wait if:**
- You're in a team using pip
- You have complex legacy setups
- You're just starting (learn basics first)

<Note>
  uv is backwards compatible - it can read requirements.txt and work with existing projects!
