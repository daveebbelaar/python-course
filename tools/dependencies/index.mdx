## Why modern tools matter

You've learned pip and virtual environments - that's great! But there's a better way.

**Enter uv**: A modern Python package manager that's:
- **10-100x faster** than pip
- **Simpler** to use
- **More reliable**
- **All-in-one** tool

## The problem with pip

Traditional Python development has pain points:
- Slow package installation
- Confusing virtual environment commands
- Different tools for different tasks
- Easy to mess up your environment

## What is uv?

`uv` is a single tool that replaces:
- pip (package installer)
- venv (virtual environments)
- pip-tools (dependency management)
- pyenv (Python version management)

Written in Rust, it's blazingly fast and just works.

<Tip>
  Once you try uv, you'll never go back to pip. It's that much better!
