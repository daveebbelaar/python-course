## Git without the terminal

VS Code has Git built in. You can do everything with clicks instead of commands.

## The Source Control panel

Look at the left sidebar in VS Code. You'll see this icon:

- **Source Control** icon (looks like a branch)
- Shows all your changed files
- One-click commits

## Basic workflow

### 1. See your changes

Open the Source Control panel:
- Changed files appear under "Changes"
- Click any file to see what changed
- Green lines = added
- Red lines = removed

### 2. Stage changes

Before committing, you "stage" files:
- Hover over a file
- Click the **+** icon
- Or click **+** next to "Changes" to stage everything

### 3. Commit

Once files are staged:
1. Type a message in the text box
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` (or click ✓)

That's a commit!

### 4. Push to GitHub

After committing:
- Click the **...** menu in Source Control
- Click "Push"
- Or click the sync icon in the bottom status bar

## Visual features

### See changes inline

- Modified files show a colored bar in the editor
- Click the bar to see what changed
- Blue = modified, Green = added, Red = deleted

## Common VS Code Git tasks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Initialize a new repo">
    1. Open your project folder
    2. Open Source Control panel
    3. Click "Initialize Repository"
    4. That's it! Your project now uses Git
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clone a repository">
    1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`
    2. Type "Git: Clone"
    3. Paste the GitHub URL
    4. Choose where to save
    5. VS Code opens it automatically
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create a .gitignore">
    1. Create new file: `.gitignore`
    2. VS Code suggests common patterns
    3. Or use Python template:
    ```
    .venv/
    .env
    __pycache__/
    *.pyc
    .vscode/
    .DS_Store
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Discard changes">
    Made a mistake? Undo changes:
    1. In Source Control panel
    2. Right-click the file
    3. Select "Discard Changes"
    4. Confirms before reverting
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Sync button magic

The status bar shows a sync button:
- **↓ 3** means "3 commits to pull"
- **↑ 2** means "2 commits to push"
- Click it to sync everything

## Tips for beginners

1. **Commit often**: Every small feature or fix
2. **Write clear messages**: "Fix login bug" not "changes"
3. **Pull before starting**: Get latest changes first
4. **Don't commit secrets**: Check your .gitignore

<Warning>
  Never commit `.env` files or API keys! Always add them to `.gitignore` first.
</Warning>

## Terminal vs UI

Both work! Use what feels comfortable:

| Task | Terminal | VS Code UI |
|------|----------|------------|
| Stage files | `git add .` | Click + icon |
| Commit | `git commit -m "message"` | Type message + Enter |
| Push | `git push` | Click sync |
| Pull | `git pull` | Click sync |
