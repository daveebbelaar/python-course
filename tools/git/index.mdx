## What is Git?

Git is like a save system for your code. It tracks every change you make, lets you go back to previous versions, and helps you collaborate with others.

GitHub is where you store your Git projects online - think of it as Google Drive for code.

## Why you need Git

As an AI engineer, you'll use Git to:
- **Save your progress**: Never lose code again
- **Try experiments**: Test ideas without breaking working code
- **Share projects**: Show your work to employers or collaborators
- **Use AI tools**: Many AI projects are shared on GitHub

## What we'll cover

We'll focus on the essential Git commands you'll actually use:
- Understanding version control (5 minutes)
- Creating a GitHub account (5 minutes)
- Cloning and creating projects (10 minutes)
- Using Git in VS Code (10 minutes)

<Note>
  We're keeping this simple. You only need about 5-6 Git commands to be productive. We'll skip the complex stuff you won't need yet.
