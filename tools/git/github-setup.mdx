## Create your GitHub account

GitHub is free and takes 5 minutes to set up. You'll need it to:
- Back up your code
- Share your projects
- Download AI tools and examples

## Step 1: Sign up

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Enter:
   - **Username**: Pick something professional (employers will see this)
   - **Email**: Use one you check regularly
   - **Password**: Make it strong

## Step 2: Verify your account

GitHub will send you an email. Click the link to verify.

## Step 3: Set up your profile

Once logged in:
1. Click your profile picture (top right) > "Your profile"
2. Click "Edit profile"
3. Add:
   - **Name**: Your real name
   - **Image**: Add a profile picture
   - **Bio**: "Learning Python for AI development" (or similar)

## Step 4: Configure Git locally

Tell Git who you are (one-time setup):

```bash
# Open terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Use the same email you used for GitHub.

## Step 5: Choose your authentication method

There are three ways to authenticate with GitHub. Choose one:

<Note>
  **Recommended**: We suggest using GitHub CLI for the easiest setup experience. It's modern, simple, and handles authentication automatically.

  <Tab title="GitHub CLI (Recommended)">
    ### GitHub CLI (gh)
    
    Modern approach using GitHub's official tool:
    
    1. Install GitHub CLI:
       - **Windows**: Download from [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com)
       - **macOS**: `brew install gh`
       - **Linux**: See [installation guide](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)
    
    2. Authenticate:
    ```bash
    gh auth login
    ```
    
    3. Follow the prompts:
       - Choose GitHub.com
       - Choose SSH (recommended) or HTTPS
       - Authenticate with browser
    
    That's it! Git will automatically use your gh credentials.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="HTTPS with Token">
    ### Personal Access Token
    
    Traditional method using tokens:
    
    1. Go to GitHub Settings (click profile > Settings)
    2. Scroll down to "Developer settings" (left sidebar)
    3. Click "Personal access tokens" > "Tokens (classic)"
    4. Click "Generate new token" > "Generate new token (classic)"
    5. Give it a name like "My Laptop" or "VS Code"
    6. Select scopes: check `repo` (full control of repositories)
    7. Set expiration (or no expiration for convenience)
    8. Click "Generate token"
    9. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)
    
    <Warning>
      Save your token somewhere safe! You'll need it when pushing code.
    </Warning>
    
    ### Using your token
    
    When you push code for the first time:
    ```bash
    git push
    
    # GitHub will ask for:
    Username: your-github-username
    Password: paste-your-token-here (NOT your GitHub password!)
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="SSH Keys">
    ### SSH Keys
    
    The most secure method - no passwords needed:
    
    1. Generate SSH key:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    # Just press Enter for all prompts (accept defaults)
    ```
    
    2. Add to ssh-agent:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
        ```bash
        eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```bash
        # In Git Bash (not Command Prompt):
        eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    3. Copy your public key:
    ```bash
    # macOS
    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    
    # Windows (Git Bash)
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
    
    # Linux
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    # Then manually copy the output
    ```
    
    4. Add to GitHub:
       - Go to [GitHub Settings > SSH Keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
       - Click "New SSH key"
       - Give it a title (e.g., "My Laptop")
       - Paste your key
       - Click "Add SSH key"
    
    5. Test the connection:
    ```bash
    ssh -T git@github.com
    # You should see: "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."
    ```
    
    **Important**: When cloning, use SSH URLs:
    ```bash
    # SSH URL (what you want)
    git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
    
    # Not HTTPS URL
    git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
