## Two things you'll do often

1. **Clone** - Download existing projects from GitHub
2. **Create** - Start new projects and upload them

Let's learn both.

## Cloning a repository

Cloning means downloading a project from GitHub to your computer.

### Example: Clone an AI project

Let's clone a real project to see how it works:

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Instead of using `cd` to navigate:
  
  **Mac**: Right-click a folder in Finder > Services > New Terminal at Folder (or hold Option and right-click > "Open in Terminal")
  
  **Windows**: Right-click a folder in File Explorer > "Open in Terminal" (or Shift + right-click > "Open PowerShell window here")
  
  This opens the terminal already in that folder!
</Tip>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="HTTPS (Recommended)">
    ```bash
    # Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
    # Navigate to where you want the project
    cd ~/Documents  # Mac
    cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents  # Windows
    
    # Clone using HTTPS URL
    git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-python.git
    
    # Go into the project
    cd openai-quickstart-python
    
    # Open in VS Code (see note below if this doesn't work)
    code .
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="SSH">
    ```bash
    # Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
    # Navigate to where you want the project
    cd ~/Documents  # Mac
    cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents  # Windows
    
    # Clone using SSH URL
    git clone git@github.com:openai/openai-quickstart-python.git
    
    # Go into the project
    cd openai-quickstart-python
    
    # Open in VS Code (see note below if this doesn't work)
    code .
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  **If `code .` doesn't work**, you need to enable it first:
  
  **Mac:**
  1. Open VS Code
  2. Press `Cmd + Shift + P`
  3. Type "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
  4. Press Enter
  5. Restart your terminal
  
  **Windows:**
  1. During VS Code installation, check "Add to PATH"
  2. If you missed it, reinstall VS Code and check that option
  3. Or manually: Right-click project folder > "Open with Code"
</Note>

That's it! You now have the entire project on your computer.

### What just happened?

- Git downloaded all files
- Git downloaded all history
- You can now run, modify, and learn from this code

<Tip>
  Always clone into a sensible location. I recommend having a `projects` or `repos` folder in your Documents.
</Tip>

## Creating your own repository

Let's put your `python-for-ai` project on GitHub.

<Warning>
  **Critical**: Before pushing to GitHub, create a `.gitignore` file! This prevents uploading your `.venv` folder, which can be gigabytes in size and cause push failures.
</Warning>

### Step 0: Create .gitignore file

Before anything else, create a `.gitignore` file in your project:

```
# .gitignore - tells Git what NOT to track
.venv/
.env
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.DS_Store
```

Save this file in your project root. Git will now ignore these files.

### Step 1: Create on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the green "New" button (or + icon > "New repository")
3. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `python-for-ai`
   - **Description**: "Learning Python for AI development"
   - **Public/Private**: Choose Private for now
   - **Don't** add README, .gitignore, or license
4. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect your local project

GitHub will show you commands. Choose based on your authentication method:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="HTTPS (Recommended)">
    ```bash
    # Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
    # Navigate to your python-for-ai folder
    cd ~/Documents/python-for-ai  # Mac
    cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\python-for-ai  # Windows
    
    # Initialize Git in your project
    git init
    
    # Add all your files
    git add .
    
    # Create your first commit
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    
    # Rename branch to main
    git branch -M main
    
    # Connect to GitHub with HTTPS (use YOUR username)
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/python-for-ai.git
    
    # Push your code
    git push -u origin main
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="SSH">
    ```bash
    # Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
    # Navigate to your python-for-ai folder
    cd ~/Documents/python-for-ai  # Mac
    cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\python-for-ai  # Windows
    
    # Initialize Git in your project
    git init
    
    # Add all your files
    git add .
    
    # Create your first commit
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    
    # Rename branch to main
    git branch -M main
    
    # Connect to GitHub with SSH (use YOUR username)
    git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/python-for-ai.git
    
    # Push your code
    git push -u origin main
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  When you push, GitHub will ask for your username and the personal access token (not your password!). VS Code will remember it.
</Note>

## The daily workflow

Once your project is on GitHub:

```bash
# Make changes to your code...

# Save changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Upload to GitHub
git push
```

That's 90% of what you'll do with Git!

## Common tasks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone with VS Code UI">
    1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`
    2. Type "Git: Clone"
    3. Paste the repository URL
    4. Choose where to save it
    5. VS Code opens the project automatically
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Private vs Public repos">
    - **Private**: Only you can see it (good for learning)
    - **Public**: Anyone can see it (good for portfolio)
    - You can change this later in Settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The .gitignore file">
    ```
    # .gitignore - tells Git what NOT to track
    .venv/
    .env
    __pycache__/
    *.pyc
    .DS_Store
    ```
    
    Add this file to keep junk out of your repo. The `.venv/` folder can be several gigabytes!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Practice exercise

Try this:
1. Clone any Python project that interests you
2. Create a new repo for one of your practice scripts
3. Make a change, commit, and push

## What's next?

VS Code makes Git even easier with visual tools. Let's explore those.
