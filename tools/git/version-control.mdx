## The problem Git solves

Imagine working on a Python project. You've probably done this:
- `my_script.py`
- `my_script_v2.py`
- `my_script_v2_final.py`
- `my_script_v2_final_ACTUALLY_FINAL.py`
- `my_script_backup_before_breaking_everything.py`

Git solves this mess by tracking changes properly.

## How Git works

Think of Git as taking snapshots of your code:

1. **You write code** - Make changes to your files
2. **You save a snapshot** - Called a "commit" in Git
3. **Git remembers everything** - Every snapshot, who made it, when, and why

```python
# Monday: Your code works
def calculate_price(amount):
    return amount * 1.20  # 20% markup

# Tuesday: Boss wants 25% markup
def calculate_price(amount):
    return amount * 1.25  # Changed from 20% to 25%

# Wednesday: "Actually, can we go back to 20%?"
# With Git: Easy! Just go back to Monday's version
# Without Git: Hope you still have that file somewhere...
```

## Key concepts (all you need)

**Repository (repo)**: A project tracked by Git
- Your `python-for-ai` folder can be a repository

**Staging**: Choosing which changes to save
- Like selecting items to put in a box before shipping

**Commit**: A saved snapshot of your code
- Like saving in a video game - you can always go back

**Push**: Upload your commits to GitHub
- Backs up your code online

**Pull**: Download changes from GitHub
- Get updates when working with others

**Clone**: Copy a project from GitHub
- How you get AI projects to try

## First: Install Git

Check if you have Git:
```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number, you're good! If not, install Git:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    1. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    2. Run the installer
    3. Keep all default settings
    4. Restart VS Code after installation
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Git comes with Xcode Command Line Tools. Just run:
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```
    
    macOS will prompt to install if needed. Click "Install" and wait a few minutes.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```bash
    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    
    # Fedora
    sudo dnf install git
    
    # Arch
    sudo pacman -S git
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The simplest Git workflow

Here's literally all you need to know for now:

<Note>
  These are terminal commands, not Python code! Run them in VS Code's terminal.
</Note>

```bash
# 0. First time only - initialize Git in your project
git init

# 1. Save your changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "Add price calculation function"

# 2. Upload to GitHub (after connecting to GitHub - see next pages)
git push

# That's it! Your code is saved and backed up
```

<Warning>
  If you see "fatal: not a git repository", you need to run `git init` first. This only needs to be done once per project.
</Warning>

You can run these commands:
- **One by one**: Type each command and press Enter
- **All together**: Copy and paste all three lines - the terminal runs them in sequence

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to use the terminal?">
    No! VS Code has buttons for all Git operations. We'll show you both ways, but you can stick to clicking buttons if you prefer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I mess up?">
    Git is very forgiving. Every commit is saved forever, so you can always go back. It's actually harder to lose work with Git than without it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Git the same as GitHub?">
    No. Git is the tool on your computer. GitHub is a website that stores Git projects. You can use Git without GitHub, but GitHub makes sharing easier.
