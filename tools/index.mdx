## Tools for real Python development

You've learned Python and built your first projects. Now let's add the essential tools that make Python development easier and more professional.

## What you'll learn

Every Python developer needs these tools:
- **Git & GitHub** - Save your work and collaborate with others
- **Environment variables** - Keep secrets safe and manage configuration  
- **Code quality** - Automatically format and lint your code
- **Modern Python tools** - Better ways to manage packages and dependencies

These tools are especially important for AI development, where you'll share code, work with API keys, and manage complex dependencies.
