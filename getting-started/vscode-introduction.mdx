## The #1 code editor for Python

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is the most popular code editor for Python development right now, including popular forks like Cursor and Windsurf.

**It's completely free** and gives you everything you need to write professional Python code. No limitations, no trial periods, just a powerful tool that millions of developers use every day.

## Works with AI coding tools

If you've heard about AI-powered coding assistants like **Cursor** or **Windsurf**, here's something important: they're actually built on VS Code.

Everything you learn in VS Code transfers directly to these tools. Same interface, same shortcuts, same extensions. You're learning a skill that works everywhere.

## Why I recommend it

I've been using VS Code (and now Cursor) for the past 5 years for all development projects we do for our clients at Datalumina. There's literally nothing you can't do with it or would need another tool for.

## What is an IDE?

IDE stands for **Integrated Development Environment**. Think of it as a smart text editor designed specifically for coding.

Instead of just typing text, an IDE:
- Highlights your code in different colors
- Shows errors before you run your program
- Suggests code as you type
- Runs your programs with one click
- Helps you organize large projects

VS Code is technically a "code editor" but with extensions, it becomes a full IDE.
