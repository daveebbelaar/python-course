## The #1 code editor for Python

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is the most popular code editor for Python developmentâ€”and for good reason.

**It's completely free** and gives you everything you need to write professional Python code. No limitations, no trial periods, just a powerful tool that millions of developers use every day.

## Works with AI coding tools

If you've heard about AI-powered coding assistants like **Cursor** or **Windsurf**, here's something important: they're actually built on VS Code.

Everything you learn in VS Code transfers directly to these tools. Same interface, same shortcuts, same extensions. You're learning a skill that works everywhere.

## Why I recommend it

I've been using VS Code (and now Cursor) for the past 5 years for all development projects we do for our clients at Datalumina. There's literally nothing you can't do with it or would need another tool for.

From simple scripts to complex AI applications, VS Code handles it all:
- Smart code completion
- Instant error detection
- Built-in terminal
- Thousands of extensions
- Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## What is an IDE?

IDE stands for **Integrated Development Environment**. Think of it as a smart text editor designed specifically for coding.

Instead of just typing text, an IDE:
- Highlights your code in different colors
- Shows errors before you run your program
- Suggests code as you type
- Runs your programs with one click
- Helps you organize large projects

VS Code is technically a "code editor" but with extensions, it becomes a full IDE.
