    4. **Important**: Check these options during installation:
       - ✓ Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer file context menu
       - ✓ Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer directory context menu
       - ✓ Register Code as an editor for supported file types

    2. Click the download button (it detects macOS automatically)
    3. Open the downloaded `.zip` file
    4. Drag **Visual Studio Code** to your **Applications** folder
    5. Optional but recommended:
       - Right-click VS Code in Applications
       - Select "Options" > "Keep in Dock"
    
    **First time opening**:
    - You might see "Visual Studio Code is from an unidentified developer"
    - Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy
    - Click "Open Anyway"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Linux">
    VS Code is available through multiple installation methods:
    
    **Ubuntu/Debian** (recommended):
    ```bash
    # Download the .deb package
    wget -O vscode.deb "https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-deb-x64"
    
    # Install it
    sudo apt install ./vscode.deb
    ```
    
    **Snap package** (works on most distributions):
    ```bash
    sudo snap install code --classic
    ```
    
    **Other distributions**:
    Visit [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and select your package format (.rpm, .tar.gz, etc.)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify installation

Once installed, let's make sure VS Code is working:

1. Open VS Code:
   - **Windows**: Search "Visual Studio Code" in Start menu
   - **macOS**: Find it in Applications or press `Cmd + Space` and search
   - **Linux**: Type `code` in terminal or find it in your applications menu

2. You should see the Welcome tab
3. The interface should look clean and modern

## Install Python extension

VS Code needs the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) to work properly with Python files:

1. Click the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (it looks like 4 squares)
2. Search for "Python"
3. Find the one by **Microsoft** (it has millions of downloads)
4. Click "Install"
5. Wait for installation to complete

<Note>
  The Python extension adds syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and more. It's essential for Python development.
</Note>

## Additional recommended extensions

While VS Code works great with just the Python extension, here are a few more I recommend:

### Pylance
- Search for "Pylance" by Microsoft
- Provides even better code completion and error detection
- Works alongside the Python extension

### Jupyter
- Search for "Jupyter" by Microsoft  
- Enables interactive Python mode (we'll use this later)
- Essential for data science and AI work

### Path Intellisense
- Search for "Path Intellisense" by Christian Kohler
- Auto-completes file paths as you type
- Prevents typos when working with files

## Customize appearance (optional)

I've been using these settings for years - they're easy on the eyes:

### Theme
- Install "Atom One Dark Theme"
- Press `Ctrl/Cmd + K`, then `Ctrl/Cmd + T` to select it

### Icons
- Install "Material Icon Theme" by Philipp Kief
- Makes file types easier to recognize

### Tree indentation
- Open Settings (`Ctrl/Cmd + ,`)
- Search for "tree indent"
- Change from 8 to 20 for clearer folder structure

## Check Python detection

After setting up VS Code:

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (macOS)
2. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. You should see your Python installation listed
4. If not, we'll fix this in the next section
