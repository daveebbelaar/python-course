## Your Python installation

Remember when we installed Python? That installation lives in a specific folder on your computer:
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\`
- **macOS**: `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/`
- **Linux**: `/usr/bin/python3`

This is your "system Python" - it's shared by everything on your computer.

## The problem with sharing

Imagine you're working on two projects:
- **Project A** needs version 1.0 of a tool
- **Project B** needs version 2.0 of the same tool

If you install version 2.0 for Project B, you just broke Project A! This is where virtual environments save the day.

## What are virtual environments?

A virtual environment is like a private copy of Python for each project. Think of it as:
- A separate folder for each project
- Its own Python installation
- Its own place to install packages
- Complete isolation from other projects

<Note>
  Virtual environments are so important that I create a new one for EVERY project. It's a Python best practice that will save you from many headaches.
</Note>

## Understanding packages

Before we continue, let's understand what packages are:

**Packages** are pre-written code that others have created for us to use. Instead of writing everything from scratch, we can import these packages. For example:
- `requests` - for downloading web pages
- `pandas` - for working with data
- `openai` - for using AI models

Each package has different versions, and different projects might need different versions.

## Create your first virtual environment

Let's create one for our `python-for-ai` project. You have two methods:

### Method 1: VS Code Command Palette (easier)

1. Open your project in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`
3. Type "Python: Create Environment"
4. Select "Venv"
5. Select your Python installation
6. VS Code creates and activates everything for you!

### Method 2: Terminal command

1. Open the terminal in VS Code (View > Terminal)
2. Make sure you're in your project folder
3. Run this command:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

What this does:
- `python -m venv` - Run Python's virtual environment module
- `.venv` - The name of the folder to create (convention is to use ".venv" with a dot)

## What just happened?

Look at your project folder - you now have a new `.venv` folder:

```
python-for-ai/
├── .venv/          # Your virtual environment (hidden folder)
├── hello.py        # Your code
└── python-for-ai.code-workspace
```

<Note>
  The dot in `.venv` makes it a hidden folder on Mac/Linux. This keeps your project clean since you don't need to see this folder often.
</Note>

This `.venv` folder contains:
- A copy of Python
- A place to install packages
- Scripts to activate/deactivate

## Activate your virtual environment

VS Code makes activation super easy:

1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` to open Command Palette
2. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. Choose the one that says `.venv` (it will show the full path like `./.venv/bin/python`)
4. That's it! VS Code automatically activates it for you

You'll know it's working when you see `(.venv)` in your terminal:
```bash
(.venv) PS C:\...\python-for-ai>
```

<Tip>
  This is my recommended approach. VS Code remembers your choice and automatically activates the environment every time you open the project!
</Tip>

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command not found" icon="circle-exclamation">
    If `python -m venv` doesn't work, you might need to install it:
    
    **Ubuntu/Debian**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-venv
    ```
    
    **Other systems**: It should come with Python by default
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission denied" icon="lock">
    On macOS/Linux, you might need to make the activate script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x .venv/bin/activate
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="VS Code not recognizing venv" icon="code">
    1. Reload VS Code window: `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` > "Developer: Reload Window"
    2. Manually select interpreter again
    3. Make sure the Python extension is installed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What's next?

Your virtual environment is ready! Now let's learn about Python packages and how to install them.
