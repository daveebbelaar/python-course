## Download Python

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. The site will detect you're on Windows and show the latest version
3. Click the download button to get the installer
4. Save it to your Downloads folder

<Tip>
  Always get Python from the official website to ensure it's secure and up-to-date.
</Tip>

## Install Python

This is the most important part - pay close attention to step 2!

1. Find and run the downloaded installer
2. **Important**: Check âœ“ "Add python.exe to PATH" at the bottom 

<Warning>
  If you miss the "Add to PATH" checkbox, Python won't work from Terminal. This is the #1 installation mistake.
</Warning>

3. Click "Install Now" (not "Customize installation" unless you know what you're doing)
4. If Windows asks "Do you want to allow this app to make changes?", click "Yes"
5. Wait for installation (usually takes 1-2 minutes)
6. Click "Close" when you see "Setup was successful"

## Verify installation

Let's make sure Python installed correctly:

1. Open Terminal:
   - Press `Windows + R`
   - Type `wt` and press `Enter`
   - Or search "Terminal" in Start menu

<Note>
  Windows Terminal is the modern app that can run Command Prompt (cmd), PowerShell, or other shells. It's the recommended way to use Python on Windows.
</Note>

2. Type this command:
```bash
python --version
```

3. You should see the Python version you just installed

<Note>
  On Windows, you can usually use `python` (not `python3` like on Mac/Linux).
</Note>

## Test Python

Let's run Python for the first time:

1. In Terminal, type:
```bash
python
```

2. You'll see something like:
```
Python 3.13.5 (tags/v3.13.5:0fa1754, Jul 29 2025, 12:03:01) [MSC v.1935 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

3. The `>>>` means Python is running! Try:
```python
print("Hello from Python!")
```

4. Press `Enter` to see:
```
Hello from Python!
```

5. To exit Python:
   - Type `exit()` and press `Enter`
   - Or press `Ctrl + Z` then `Enter`

    This means Python wasn't added to PATH. Here's how to fix it.<br /><br />
    
    **Quick Fix**: Try `py` instead of `python`:
    ```bash
    py --version
    ```
    
    **Solution 1**: Reinstall Python
    
    1. Uninstall Python from Settings > Apps
    2. Download and run installer again
    3. CHECK the "Add to PATH" box this time!
    
    **Solution 2**: Add to PATH manually
    
    1. Search "Environment Variables" in Start menu
    2. Click "Environment Variables" button
    3. Under "System variables", find and double-click "Path"
    4. Click "New" and add these two paths:
       ```
       C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313
       C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts
       ```
    5. Replace `[YourName]` with your Windows username
    6. Replace `Python313` with your actual Python version folder
    7. Click OK on all windows
    8. **Close and reopen** Terminal

  <Accordion title="Windows Defender blocking Python" icon="ban">
    Windows might flag Python as suspicious:
    
    1. When warning appears, click "More info"
    2. Click "Run anyway"
    3. Or add Python to Windows Defender exceptions:
       - Settings > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection
       - Add an exclusion > Folder
       - Add Python installation folder
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multiple Python versions" icon="code-branch">
    Windows can have multiple Python versions. To manage them:<br /><br />
    
    **See all versions**:
    ```bash
    py -0
    ```
    
    **Use specific version**:
    ```bash
    py -3.13 --version
    py -3.12 script.py
    ```
    
    **Set default version**: Create `py.ini` in your home folder with:
    ```ini
    [defaults]
    python=3.13
    ```
