## The best of both worlds

Interactive Python mode is my favorite way to write Python code, and I rarely use anything else. It combines the organization of Python files with the interactivity of Jupyter notebooks.

<Note>
  This is how I'll be coding throughout the entire course. Once you try it, you'll understand why it's so powerful for learning and developing AI applications.

## What is Interactive Python?

Imagine you're cooking and tasting as you go, rather than waiting until the entire meal is done. That's Interactive Python:

- Write code in a `.py` file (organized and clean)
- Run pieces of it instantly with `Shift + Enter`
- See results immediately in a side panel
- Keep all your variables in memory

## Why it's perfect for AI development

When working with AI and data:
- You're constantly inspecting data
- Testing transformations
- Checking outputs
- Experimenting with different approaches

Running an entire file every time (like we did with `hello.py`) would be slow and frustrating. Interactive mode lets you work iteratively.

## Prerequisites

Interactive Python requires the IPython kernel. Let's install it:

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated:
   ```bash
   # You should see (venv) in your terminal
   ```

2. Install the required package:
   ```bash
   pip install ipykernel
   ```

This package allows Jupyter to run Python code interactively.

## Set up Interactive Python

Now let's enable the interactive feature:

1. Open VS Code settings:
   - Press `Ctrl/Cmd + ,` (comma)
   - Or File > Preferences > Settings

2. Search for "execute selection"

3. Find this setting:
   **Jupyter > Interactive Window > Text Editor: Execute Selection**

4. Check the box to enable it

What this does: When you press `Shift + Enter`, your selected code will run in the Jupyter interactive window instead of the Python terminal. This gives you a much richer, more visual experience.

That's it! You're ready to use interactive mode.

## Your first interactive session

1. Create a new file called `interactive_demo.py`

2. Type this code:
```python
# Let's explore interactive mode
name = "Python Learner"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Some data to work with
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"Numbers: {numbers}")

# Calculate something
total = sum(numbers)
print(f"Total: {total}")
```

3. Place your cursor on the first line

4. Press `Shift + Enter`

Watch what happens:
- An Interactive window opens on the right
- Your code runs line by line
- You see output immediately

## Interactive superpowers

### Run selected code
- Highlight any code
- Press `Shift + Enter`
- Only that selection runs

### Variables stay in memory

Run this step by step:
```python
# First, create a variable
message = "Hello"

# Later, use it (even in a different cell)
print(message + " World!")

# Modify it
message = message.upper()
print(message)
```

The variable `message` stays available throughout your session!
