## Make VS Code yours

VS Code becomes even more powerful with extensions and customizations. Here are the ones I use and recommend for Python development.

<Note>
  All of these are optional! VS Code works great out of the box, but these additions can make your coding experience even better.
</Note>

## Recommended Python extensions

### Pylance

The most important extension after the base Python extension:

1. Open Extensions sidebar (click the 4 squares icon)
2. Search for "Pylance"
3. Install the one by **Microsoft**
4. What it does:
   - Shows errors as you type
   - Provides better code suggestions
   - Helps you write Python faster

### Jupyter

Essential for data science and AI work:

1. Search for "Jupyter"
2. Install the one by **Microsoft**
3. What it does:
   - Run Python notebooks (.ipynb files)
   - Execute code in chunks
   - Perfect for experimentation
   - Enables interactive mode (more on this later)

We'll use this later in the course for AI projects and interactive coding.

### Path Intellisense

Makes working with file paths much easier:

1. Search for "Path Intellisense"
2. Install the one by **Christian Kohler**
3. What it does:
   - Auto-completes file paths as you type
   - Shows available files and folders
   - No more typos in file paths!

Super helpful when you're loading data files or importing modules.

## Theme and appearance

I've been using the same theme for years because it's easy on the eyes:

### Atom One Dark theme

1. Search for "Atom One Dark"
2. Install "Atom One Dark Theme"
3. When prompted, select it as your color theme
4. Or manually: Press `Ctrl/Cmd + K`, then `Ctrl/Cmd + T` and select "Atom One Dark"

### Material Icon Theme

Makes your file icons more recognizable:

1. Search for "Material Icon Theme"
2. Install the one by Philipp Kief
3. When prompted, activate the icon theme
4. Your files now have colorful, meaningful icons

## My personal settings

### Increase file tree indentation

I find the default indentation too small. Here's how to change it:

1. Open settings:
   - Press `Ctrl/Cmd + ,` (comma)
   - Or go to File > Preferences > Settings
2. In the search bar, type "tree indent"
3. Find "Workbench > Tree: Indent"
4. Change the value from 8 to **20**

This makes nested folders much easier to see.

### Alternative: Edit settings directly

For power users, you can edit the settings file:

1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`
2. Type "Open User Settings (JSON)"
3. Add this line:
```json
"workbench.tree.indent": 20,
```

## Your VS Code setup

After these customizations, your VS Code will have:
- ✓ Python and Pylance for smart coding
- ✓ Jupyter for notebooks and interactive Python
- ✓ Path Intellisense for easy file navigation
- ✓ Atom One Dark theme for comfortable viewing
- ✓ Material icons for better file recognition
- ✓ Increased tree indent for clearer folder structure

<Tip>
  You'll be spending a lot of time in VS Code throughout this course, so make it yours! Feel free to explore other settings and extensions to create a development environment you love working in.
</Tip>

## Other useful extensions

While not required for this course, you might enjoy:
- **Python Docstring Generator** - Auto-generate documentation
- **Better Comments** - Colorize different types of comments

## Reset if needed

Changed something you don't like? You can always:
- Disable extensions individually
- Change themes back: `Ctrl/Cmd + K`, then `Ctrl/Cmd + T`
- Reset all settings: Command Palette > "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)" > click the gear icon > "Reset Setting"
