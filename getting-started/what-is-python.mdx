## What is programming?

Programming is writing instructions for computers to follow. Just like you might write a recipe for someone to cook a meal, you write code to tell a computer what to do.

Computers are powerful but not smart. They need extremely detailed, step-by-step instructions for everything. A programming language is how we write these instructions in a way both humans and computers can understand.

## Why do we need programming languages?

Computers only understand binary (1s and 0s). Writing in binary would be impossible for humans, so we use programming languages as a middle ground:

1. **You write** code in Python (looks like English)
2. **Python translates** your code into instructions
3. **Computer executes** those instructions

## Your first taste of Python

Here's what Python code looks like:

```python
# This is Python code - it almost reads like English!
name = "Sarah"
age = 25
print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old")

# Making a simple decision
if age >= 18:
    print("I can vote!")
else:
    print("I'm too young to vote")
```

Notice how readable it is? That's Python's superpower.

## Python versions explained

- **Python 3** (current version): This is what you'll learn and use. Check the versions [here](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).

- **Python 2** (outdated): Stopped being supported in 2020. You might see old code mentioning it, but ignore it - it's like using Windows XP.

Always use Python 3. If you see tutorials mentioning Python 2, find newer ones.
