## Why operating systems matter

Different operating systems handle programs differently:
- **Installation methods**: Windows uses installers, Mac uses DMG files, Linux uses package managers
- **System commands**: Each OS has different terminal commands

Don't worry - Python works the same way once installed. The installation process is just different for each system.
