## Standing on the shoulders of giants

One of Python's superpowers is its massive collection of packages. Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can use code that others have already written, tested, and shared.

Think of it like cooking:
- You could grow wheat, mill flour, and bake bread from scratch
- Or you could buy a loaf from the bakery
- Both get you bread, but one is much faster!

## What are packages?

**Packages** are collections of Python code that solve specific problems:

- **requests** - Download web pages and data
- **pandas** - Work with spreadsheets and data
- **numpy** - Fast mathematical operations
- **openai** - Connect to AI models
- **beautifulsoup4** - Extract data from websites

Each package is like a toolbox with specialized tools for a specific job.

## Meet pip

**pip** (Pip Installs Packages) is Python's package manager. It:
- Downloads packages from the internet
- Installs them in your environment
- Manages versions and dependencies

<Note>
  pip comes with Python, so you already have it! When you activated your virtual environment, you got your own copy of pip.
</Note>

## Your first package installation

Let's install a real package to see how it works:

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated:
   ```bash
   # You should see (.venv) in your terminal
   ```

2. Install the `requests` package:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. You'll see output like:
   ```
   Collecting requests
   Downloading requests-2.31.0-py3-none-any.whl (62 kB)
   Installing collected packages: requests
   Successfully installed requests-2.31.0
   ```

That's it! You just installed your first package.

## Using installed packages

Now you can use this package in your Python code:

```python
import requests

# Download a web page
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print(response.status_code)  # Should print 200
```

Without the requests package, downloading web data would require dozens of lines of complex code. With it, it's just two lines!

## See what's installed

To check which packages you have:

```bash
pip list
```

Output:
```
Package            Version
------------------ --------
certifi           2024.2.2
charset-normalizer 3.3.2
idna              3.6
pip               24.0
requests          2.31.0
urllib3           2.2.0
```

Notice how installing `requests` also installed other packages it needs (like `urllib3`). pip handles this automatically!

## Install specific versions

Sometimes you need a specific version of a package:

```bash
# Install exact version
pip install requests==2.30.0

# Install minimum version
pip install requests>=2.28.0

# Install compatible version
pip install requests~=2.31.0
```

## Uninstall packages

Made a mistake or no longer need something?

```bash
pip uninstall requests
```

pip will ask for confirmation before removing it.

## Where packages come from

pip downloads packages from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (Python Package Index), which hosts over 500,000 packages! Anyone can upload packages there, which is why Python has tools for everything.

## Common packages you'll use

As you progress through this course, you'll use packages like:

- **ipykernel** - For interactive Python (next section!)
- **pandas** - Data analysis
- **matplotlib** - Creating charts
- **openai** - AI integration
- **streamlit** - Building web apps

## Best practices

1. **Install in virtual environments** - Never in system Python
2. **Install only what you need** - Don't bloat your project
3. **Document your packages** - We'll learn about requirements.txt later
4. **Check package reputation** - Look for well-maintained, popular packages

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="pip: command not found" icon="exclamation-circle">
    Your virtual environment might not be activated:
    
    1. Check for `(.venv)` in your terminal prompt
    2. If missing, activate it using VS Code's Python interpreter selection
    3. Or activate manually with the terminal commands from the previous section
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission denied" icon="lock">
    You're probably trying to install in system Python:
    
    - Make sure your virtual environment is activated
    - Never use `sudo pip install`
    - Always see `(.venv)` before installing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Package not found" icon="search">
    The package name might be different from what you expect:
    
    - Check the exact name on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org)
    - Example: "Beautiful Soup" is actually `beautifulsoup4`
    - Example: "OpenAI" is just `openai` (lowercase)
  </Accordion>

## Ready for interactive Python

Now that you understand packages, let's install what we need for interactive Python mode!
