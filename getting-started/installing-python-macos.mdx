## Check existing Python

macOS includes an older Python version for system use. Let's check what you have:

1. Open Terminal:
   - Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight
   - Type "Terminal" and press Enter
   - Or find Terminal in Applications > Utilities

2. Check Python version:
```bash
python3 --version
```

If you see a recent Python 3 version, you might already be set!

<Note>
  Some Mac users can use just `python` instead of `python3`, but this depends on your system configuration. When in doubt, use `python3`.
</Note>

## Download Python

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. The site will detect you're on macOS and show the latest version
3. Click the download button to get the `.pkg` installer

<Tip>
  Always download from python.org to ensure you get the official, secure version.
</Tip>

## Install Python

1. Open the downloaded `.pkg` file
2. The Python installer will open
3. Click "Continue" through the introduction and license screens
4. Click "Agree" to accept the license
5. Click "Install" (you'll need to enter your Mac password)
6. Wait for installation to complete
7. Click "Close" when you see "The installation was successful"

## Verify installation

Open a **new** Terminal window (important!) and check the version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see the version you just installed. The exact number depends on when you download.

## Test Python

Let's make sure Python works properly:

1. In Terminal, type:
```bash
python3
```

2. You'll see something like:
```
Python 3.13.5 (v3.13.5:0fa1754080, Jul 29 2025, 09:45:56) [Clang 15.0.0] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

3. Try your first Python command:
```python
print("Hello from Python!")
```

4. Press `Enter` and you should see:
```
Hello from Python!
```

5. To exit Python:
   - Type `exit()` and press Enter
   - Or press `Ctrl + D`


## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'python3' command not found" icon="circle-exclamation">
    The Terminal might not see the new installation yet.<br /><br />
    
    **Solution 1**: Close Terminal completely and open a new window.<br /><br />
    
    **Solution 2**: Check if Python is installed but not in PATH:
    ```bash
    ls /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/
    ```
    
    **Solution 3**: Add Python to your PATH manually:
    ```bash
    echo 'export PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="'python' command doesn't work" icon="code">
    This is normal on macOS. You have three options:<br /><br />
    
    **Option 1**: Always use `python3` (recommended)<br /><br />
    
    **Option 2**: Create an alias:
    ```bash
    echo 'alias python=python3' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'alias pip=pip3' >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
    
    **Option 3**: Check if the installer created a `python` link:
    ```bash
    which python
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SSL/Certificate errors" icon="lock">
    You forgot to install certificates. Fix it by<br /><br />
    
    Running from Terminal:
    ```bash
    /Applications/Python\ 3.*/Install\ Certificates.command
    ```
    
    Or manually installing certificates:
    ```bash
    pip3 install --upgrade certifi
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multiple Python versions" icon="circle-exclamation">
    macOS can have multiple Python versions. To manage them:<br /><br />
    
    **See all installed versions**:
    ```bash
    ls -la /usr/local/bin/python*
    ```
    
    **Use a specific version**:
    ```bash
    python3.13 --version
    python3.12 --version
    ```
    
    **Set a default** (example for 3.13):
    ```bash
    ln -s -f /usr/local/bin/python3.13 /usr/local/bin/python3
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Alternative: Homebrew installation

If you prefer using a package manager:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Homebrew">
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Python">
    ```bash
    brew install python@3
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Homebrew Python might use different paths than the official installer. Both work fine.
</Note>

## Next steps

Perfect! Python is now installed on your Mac. Let's set up your code editor.
