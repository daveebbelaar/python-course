## What is programming?

Programming is simply giving instructions to a computer. Think of it like writing a recipe - you tell the computer exactly what to do, step by step.

When you cook, you follow steps: "Heat oil, add onions, stir for 2 minutes." Programming is the same, except you're telling a computer what to do instead of cooking.

## Computers are literal

Here's the key thing: computers do exactly what you tell them - nothing more, nothing less. They can't guess what you mean.

If you tell a friend "make coffee," they know what to do. But a computer needs every detail:
1. Get a cup
2. Add coffee grounds
3. Pour hot water
4. Wait 3 minutes
5. Add milk if desired

## Basic programming operations

All programming, regardless of language, boils down to a few basic operations:

**Store information**
```
age = 25
name = "Sarah"
```

**Make decisions**
```
if it's raining:
    take umbrella
else:
    wear sunglasses
```

**Repeat actions**
```
repeat 10 times:
    do pushup
```

**Calculate things**
```
total = price + tax
```

## Your journey

Right now, this might feel abstract. That's normal! As we move through Python basics, each concept will click into place.

Programming is a skill like any other - it takes practice, but anyone can learn it.

## What's next?

Now let's dive into Python syntax - the specific rules for writing Python programs.
