## What is code formatting?

Writing clean, consistent code is important. Code formatting means organizing your code so it's easy to read and follows Python's style guidelines.

## Basic formatting principles

Follow these basic rules for readability:

### Indentation
Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs):

```python
def greet(name):
    if name:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    else:
        print("Hello!")
```

### Spacing
Add spaces around operators and after commas:

```python
# Good
x = 1 + 2
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Bad
x=1+2
numbers=[1,2,3,4]
```

### Blank lines
Use blank lines to separate functions and logical sections:

```python
def first_function():
    pass


def second_function():
    pass
```

### Line length
Keep lines under 80-100 characters. Break long lines for readability:

```python
# Good - readable
long_string = (
    "This is a very long string that "
    "spans multiple lines for readability"
)

# Bad - too long
long_string = "This is a very long string that spans multiple lines for readability but keeps going and going"
```

  Later in the course, you'll learn about Ruff - a tool that automatically formats your code. But understanding these basics first helps you write better code naturally.
