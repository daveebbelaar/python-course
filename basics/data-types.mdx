## What are data types?

Just like in real life, Python works with different kinds of information:
- **Numbers** for counting and math (age, price, score)
- **Text** for words and sentences (names, messages)
- **True/False** for yes/no decisions (is it raining? are you logged in?)

Python needs to know what type of data you're working with so it can handle it correctly.

## The main data types

### Integers (whole numbers)

Integers are whole numbers without decimal points:

```python
age = 25
score = -10
population = 8_000_000  # Underscores for readability
```

### Floats (decimal numbers)

Floats are numbers with decimal points:

```python
price = 19.99
temperature = -5.5
pi = 3.14159
```

### Strings (text)

Strings are text, always in quotes:

```python
name = "Alice"          # Double quotes
message = 'Hello!'      # Single quotes work too
paragraph = """This is
a multi-line
string"""               # Triple quotes for multiple lines
```

### Booleans (True/False)

Booleans represent true or false:

```python
is_logged_in = True
is_admin = False
has_permission = True
```

<Note>
  Boolean values are `True` and `False` with capital letters. Using `true` or `false` will cause an error!
</Note>

## Checking data types

Use `type()` to check what type something is:

```python
# Check types
print(type(42))           # <class 'int'>
print(type(3.14))         # <class 'float'>
print(type("Hello"))      # <class 'str'>
print(type(True))         # <class 'bool'>

# Store in variables and check
age = 25
print(type(age))          # <class 'int'>
```

## Type conversion

Sometimes you need to convert between types:

```python
# String to integer
user_input = "25"
age = int(user_input)
print(age + 5)  # 30

# Integer to string
score = 100
message = "Your score: " + str(score)
print(message)  # Your score: 100

# String to float
price_text = "19.99"
price = float(price_text)
total = price * 2  # 39.98
```

## Mixed operations

Python is smart about mixing integers and floats:

```python
# Integer + float = float
result = 10 + 5.5
print(result)        # 15.5
print(type(result))  # <class 'float'>

# But you can't mix numbers and strings
age = 25
# message = "I am " + age  # Error!
message = "I am " + str(age)  # Convert first
```

## Try it yourself

Create `data_types_practice.py`:

```python
# Create one variable of each type
my_age = 25                    # integer
my_height = 5.9               # float
my_name = "Python Learner"    # string
likes_coding = True           # boolean

# Print them with their types
print("Age:", my_age, "- Type:", type(my_age))
print("Height:", my_height, "- Type:", type(my_height))
print("Name:", my_name, "- Type:", type(my_name))
print("Likes coding:", likes_coding, "- Type:", type(likes_coding))

# Type conversion practice
birth_year = "1998"
birth_year_int = int(birth_year)
current_year = 2024
age = current_year - birth_year_int
print("You are", age, "years old")
```

### Challenges

1. Create a variable with your height in feet (float) and convert it to inches (multiply by 12)
2. Ask the user for their age as input and add 10 to it (hint: input() returns a string)
3. Create a program that calculates the total price of items including tax

## Common mistakes

### Forgetting to convert types
```python
# Wrong
age = input("Enter age: ")  # This is a string!
next_year = age + 1         # Error: can't add string and int

# Right
age = int(input("Enter age: "))
next_year = age + 1
```

### Mixing incompatible types
```python
# Wrong
result = "The answer is " + 42  # Error

# Right
result = "The answer is " + str(42)
```

### Boolean capitalization
```python
# Wrong
is_ready = true   # NameError: 'true' is not defined

# Right
is_ready = True   # Capital T
```

## Special values

Python has some special values:

```python
# None represents "nothing"
result = None

# You can check for None
if result is None:
    print("No result yet")

# Infinity (for floats)
import math
infinite = math.inf
```
