## Your Python foundation

Welcome to Python Basics! This is where you'll learn the fundamental building blocks that every Python program uses.

Think of it like learning a new language:
- First, you learn words (variables and data types)
- Then, you learn how to make sentences (operators and expressions)
- Finally, you learn grammar rules (control flow)

## How to use this section

Each topic builds on the previous one, so I recommend going in order. Every page follows the same format:

1. **What is it?** - Simple explanation of the concept
2. **See it in action** - Live examples you can try
3. **Try it yourself** - Exercises to practice
4. **Common mistakes** - Things to watch out for

<Tip>
  Use Interactive Python mode (Shift + Enter) to try examples as you go. This makes learning much more fun and effective!
