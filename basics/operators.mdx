## What are operators?

Operators are symbols that perform operations on values. Just like in math class, you use operators to:
- Calculate numbers (+ - ร รท)
- Compare values (greater than, equal to)
- Make logical decisions (and, or, not)

Think of operators as the "verbs" of programming - they make things happen!

## Arithmetic operators

These work just like your calculator:

```python
# Basic math
print(10 + 3)   # 13 - Addition
print(10 - 3)   # 7  - Subtraction
print(10 * 3)   # 30 - Multiplication
print(10 / 3)   # 3.333... - Division (always gives float)

# Special operators
print(10 // 3)  # 3  - Floor division (rounds down)
print(10 % 3)   # 1  - Modulo (remainder)
print(10 ** 3)  # 1000 - Exponent (power)
```

### Order of operations

Python follows PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction):

```python
result = 2 + 3 * 4      # 14 (not 20!)
result = (2 + 3) * 4    # 20 (parentheses first)
result = 2 ** 3 * 4     # 32 (exponent first, then multiply)
```

## Assignment operators

These shortcuts make updating variables easier:

```python
# Long way
score = score + 10

# Shortcut
score += 10

# All assignment operators
x = 10
x += 5    # x = x + 5  (now 15)
x -= 3    # x = x - 3  (now 12)
x *= 2    # x = x * 2  (now 24)
x /= 4    # x = x / 4  (now 6.0)
x //= 2   # x = x // 2 (now 3.0)
x %= 2    # x = x % 2  (now 1.0)
x **= 3   # x = x ** 3 (now 1.0)
```

## Comparison operators

These compare values and return True or False:

```python
age = 18

print(age == 18)    # True  - Equal to
print(age != 21)    # True  - Not equal to
print(age > 17)     # True  - Greater than
print(age < 20)     # True  - Less than
print(age >= 18)    # True  - Greater than or equal
print(age <= 18)    # True  - Less than or equal
```

<Warning>
  Don't confuse `=` (assignment) with `==` (comparison)!
  - `age = 18` stores 18 in age
  - `age == 18` checks if age equals 18
</Warning>

## String operators

Strings have special operators:

```python
# Concatenation (joining)
first = "Python"
last = "Programming"
full = first + " " + last  # "Python Programming"

# Repetition
laugh = "Ha" * 3  # "HaHaHa"
line = "-" * 20   # "--------------------"

# Membership
message = "Hello World"
print("Hello" in message)     # True
print("Goodbye" in message)   # False
print("hello" in message)     # False (case sensitive!)
```

## Logical operators

These combine conditions:

```python
age = 25
has_license = True

# AND - both must be true
can_drive = age >= 16 and has_license
print(can_drive)  # True

# OR - at least one must be true
is_weekend = day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday"

# NOT - reverses the value
is_child = not age >= 18
```

### Truth table
```python
# AND
True and True   # True
True and False  # False
False and True  # False
False and False # False

# OR
True or True    # True
True or False   # True
False or True   # True
False or False  # False

# NOT
not True        # False
not False       # True
```

## Try it yourself

Create `operators_practice.py`:

```python
# Calculator program
num1 = 10
num2 = 3

print("Calculator Results:")
print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")
print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}")
print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}")
print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2:.2f}")
print(f"{num1} // {num2} = {num1 // num2}")
print(f"{num1} % {num2} = {num1 % num2}")
print(f"{num1} ** {num2} = {num1 ** num2}")

# Comparison practice
my_age = 25
print("\nAge checks:")
print(f"Can vote (>= 18): {my_age >= 18}")
print(f"Can rent car (>= 25): {my_age >= 25}")
print(f"Is teenager: {my_age >= 13 and my_age <= 19}")

# String operations
first_name = "Python"
last_name = "Coder"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(f"\nHello, {full_name}!")
print("*" * len(full_name))  # Underline with stars
```

### Challenges

1. Create a tip calculator that calculates 15%, 18%, and 20% tips
2. Check if a number is even (hint: use modulo)
3. Create a program that checks if someone can vote AND drink (different ages)

## Common mistakes

### Integer division surprise
```python
# Careful with division
result = 5 / 2    # 2.5 (float)
result = 5 // 2   # 2 (integer)
```

### Order of operations
```python
# Wrong
average = 10 + 20 + 30 / 3  # 40.0 (not 20!)

# Right
average = (10 + 20 + 30) / 3  # 20.0
```

### Chaining comparisons
```python
# Python allows this!
age = 25
is_twenties = 20 <= age <= 29  # True

# Same as
is_twenties = age >= 20 and age <= 29
```

## Pro tips

1. **Use parentheses for clarity**
   ```python
   # Hard to read
   result = x + y * z - a / b
   
   # Clear
   result = x + (y * z) - (a / b)
   ```

2. **Modulo for cycles**
   ```python
   # Check even/odd
   if number % 2 == 0:
       print("Even")
   
   # Cycle through 0-4
   for i in range(20):
       position = i % 5
   ```
