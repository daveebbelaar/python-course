## What are comments?

Comments are notes for humans that Python ignores. They're like sticky notes in your code that explain what's happening.

Why write comments?
- Help others understand your code
- Help future you remember what you did
- Disable code temporarily
- Document complex logic

## Single-line comments

Use `#` to start a comment:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello")  # This is also a comment

# You can have multiple lines
# of comments by starting
# each line with a hash

age = 25  # Store user's age
```

## Multi-line comments

For longer explanations, use triple quotes:

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span several lines.
Great for longer explanations.
"""

def calculate_tip(bill):
    """
    Calculate 20% tip for a restaurant bill.
    Takes the bill amount and returns the tip.
    """
    return bill * 0.20
```

<Note>
  Technically, triple quotes create a string that Python doesn't use. Real multi-line comments don't exist in Python, but this works the same way!
</Note>

## When to use comments

### Good comments explain WHY

```python
# Good: Explains why
# Using 1.0625 because sales tax in CA is 6.25%
total = subtotal * 1.0625

# Bad: Explains what (obvious from code)
# Multiply subtotal by 1.0625
total = subtotal * 1.0625
```

### Document complex logic

```python
# Check if year is leap year
# Leap years are divisible by 4, except centuries
# unless they're divisible by 400
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year")
```

### TODO comments

```python
def process_payment(amount):
    # TODO: Add payment validation
    # TODO: Connect to payment gateway
    # FIXME: Handle negative amounts
    return True  # Temporary
```

## Comment best practices

### Keep comments updated

```python
# Bad: Outdated comment
# Calculate 15% tip (but code does 20%)
tip = bill * 0.20

# Good: Accurate comment
# Calculate 20% tip (standard for good service)
tip = bill * 0.20
```

### Don't over-comment

```python
# Bad: Too many obvious comments
x = 5  # Set x to 5
y = 10  # Set y to 10
z = x + y  # Add x and y
print(z)  # Print z

# Good: Comment only what needs explanation
# Calculate coordinates for game grid
x = 5
y = 10
position = x + y  # Linear index from 2D coordinates
print(position)
```

### Use descriptive names instead

```python
# Instead of this:
d = 7  # days in a week

# Write this:
days_in_week = 7
```

## Commenting techniques

### Header comments

```python
# ========================================
# Student Grade Calculator
# Author: Your Name
# Date: 2024-01-01
# Description: Calculates final grades
# ========================================

def calculate_grade(scores):
    """Calculate average grade from list of scores."""
    return sum(scores) / len(scores)
```

### Inline explanations

```python
# Process user data
users = get_all_users()
active_users = [u for u in users if u.active]  # Filter inactive
vip_users = [u for u in active_users if u.vip]  # Further filter
```

### Commenting out code

```python
print("Starting process...")
# print("Debug: Checking values")  # Uncomment for debugging
# old_method()  # Deprecated, keeping for reference
new_method()
```

## Documentation strings (docstrings)

Special comments for functions and classes:

```python
def convert_temperature(celsius):
    """
    Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
    
    Args:
        celsius (float): Temperature in Celsius
    
    Returns:
        float: Temperature in Fahrenheit
    
    Example:
        >>> convert_temperature(0)
        32.0
    """
    return (celsius * 9/5) + 32

# Access docstring
print(convert_temperature.__doc__)
```

## Try it yourself

Create `commenting_practice.py`:

```python
"""
Temperature Converter Program
Converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit
Author: [Your name]
Date: [Today's date]
"""

def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    """Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit."""
    # Formula: (C × 9/5) + 32
    return (celsius * 9/5) + 32

def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
    """Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius."""
    # Formula: (F - 32) × 5/9
    return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9

# Main program
print("TEMPERATURE CONVERTER")
print("=" * 20)

# Get user choice
# TODO: Add input validation
choice = input("Convert from (C)elsius or (F)ahrenheit? ").upper()

if choice == "C":
    # Converting from Celsius
    temp = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
    result = celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp)
    print(f"{temp}°C = {result:.1f}°F")
else:
    # Converting from Fahrenheit
    temp = float(input("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: "))
    result = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp)
    print(f"{temp}°F = {result:.1f}°C")

# TODO: Add option to convert multiple temperatures
# TODO: Add Kelvin conversion
```

### Challenges

1. Take an uncommented program and add helpful comments
2. Write a function with a complete docstring
3. Use comments to plan a program before writing code

## Common mistakes

### Contradicting code
```python
# Bad: Comment says one thing, code does another
# Check if user is adult (21+)
if age >= 18:  # This checks for 18!
    print("Adult")
```

### Commenting out instead of deleting
```python
# Bad: Leaving lots of old code
# result = old_calculation()
# result2 = another_old_way()
# final = outdated_method()
result = new_calculation()  # Just keep this
```

### Using comments instead of better code
```python
# Bad: Comment explains confusing code
# Check if x is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9
if x == 1 or x == 3 or x == 5 or x == 7 or x == 9:

# Good: Clear code needs no comment
if x in [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]:
```

## Advanced commenting

### Type hints (modern Python)
```python
def greet(name: str, age: int) -> str:
    """Create a greeting message."""
    return f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old"
```

### Disable warnings
```python
# pylint: disable=line-too-long
really_long_line_that_would_normally_trigger_a_warning = "This is OK here"

# type: ignore
result = complex_function()  # Ignore type checker here
```
