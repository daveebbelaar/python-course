## What are booleans?

Booleans are the simplest data type - they can only be `True` or `False`. Think of them as yes/no answers.

```python
is_logged_in = True
is_admin = False
has_permission = True
```

<Warning>
  Boolean values are `True` and `False` with capital letters. Using `true` or `false` will cause an error!
</Warning>

## Creating booleans

Booleans often come from comparisons:

```python
# Direct assignment
is_ready = True

# From comparisons
age = 18
can_vote = age >= 18  # True

score = 75
passed = score > 60   # True
```

## Comparison operators

These operators compare values and return `True` or `False`:

```python
age = 25

# Equality
print(age == 25)     # True - equals
print(age != 30)     # True - not equals

# Greater/Less than
print(age > 20)      # True - greater than
print(age < 30)      # True - less than
print(age >= 25)     # True - greater or equal
print(age <= 25)     # True - less or equal
```

<Note>
  Remember: `=` assigns a value, while `==` compares values. This is a common source of bugs!

## Common mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wrong capitalization">
    ```python
    # Wrong
    is_ready = true   # NameError!
    is_done = TRUE    # NameError!
    
    # Right
    is_ready = True
    is_done = False
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Using = instead of ==">
    ```python
    # Wrong - this assigns, not compares!
    if is_logged_in = True:
        print("Welcome")
    
    # Right - but redundant
    if is_logged_in == True:
        print("Welcome")
        
    # Best - booleans are already True/False
    if is_logged_in:
        print("Welcome")
    ```
  </Accordion>
