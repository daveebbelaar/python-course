## Two types of numbers

Python has two ways to store numbers:

**Integers** - Whole numbers without decimals
```python
age = 25
score = -10
```

**Floats** - Numbers with decimal points
```python
price = 19.99
temperature = -5.5
pi = 3.14159
```

<Tip>
  Python uses a dot (.) for decimals, not a comma. Writing `3,14` creates a tuple, not the number 3.14!
</Tip>

## Why two types?

Python separates integers and floats for efficiency - computers can work with whole numbers faster and more precisely. But here's the reassuring part: in practice, you rarely need to think about this. Python handles the conversion automatically when needed, and most of the time you'll just use whatever makes sense - whole numbers for counting things, decimals for measurements and calculations.

## Basic math operations

Numbers work just like a calculator:

```python
# Addition and subtraction
total = 10 + 5     # 15
change = 20 - 7    # 13

# Multiplication and division
area = 6 * 4       # 24
half = 10 / 2      # 5.0 (always returns float)

# Powers
squared = 5 ** 2   # 25
cubed = 2 ** 3     # 8
```

## Integer vs float division

Division has two forms:

```python
# Regular division (always float)
result = 10 / 3    # 3.333...

# Integer division (rounds down)
result = 10 // 3   # 3
```

<Tip>
  These are just the basics! Python can solve complex math problems too. When you need square roots, trigonometry, or advanced calculations, ask AI to help with the specific syntax - no need to memorize every math symbol right now.

## Common mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Division always returns float">
    ```python
    # Even when dividing evenly
    result = 10 / 2
    print(result)       # 5.0 (not 5)
    print(type(result)) # <class 'float'>
    
    # Use // for integer result
    result = 10 // 2    # 5
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't use commas in numbers">
    ```python
    # Wrong
    million = 1,000,000  # Creates a tuple, not a number!
    
    # Right
    million = 1000000    # Hard to read
    million = 1_000_000  # Python style
    ```
  </Accordion>
