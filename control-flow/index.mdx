## Making programs think

So far, your programs run top to bottom, executing every line. But real programs need to:
- Make decisions ("if this, then that")
- Repeat actions ("do this 10 times")
- Handle different cases ("if A do this, if B do that")

Control flow is what makes programs intelligent!

## Real-world examples

Control flow is everywhere:
- **ATM**: IF password correct, THEN allow access
- **Games**: WHILE player alive, keep playing
- **Shopping**: FOR each item in cart, add to total
- **Apps**: IF user clicks button, THEN perform action

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, make sure you understand:
- Variables and data types
- Operators (especially comparison operators)
- Boolean values (True/False)

<Tip>
  Control flow is where programming gets fun! You'll start building programs that can actually make decisions and respond to different situations.
</Tip>

## Let's begin!

Start with the foundation of all program logic: if statements.
