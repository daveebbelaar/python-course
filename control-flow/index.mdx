## Making programs think

So far, your programs run top to bottom, executing every line. But real programs need to make decisions - "if this, then that".

Control flow is what makes programs intelligent!

## What you'll learn

  Make decisions based on conditions
</Card>

## Real-world examples

Decision-making is everywhere:
- **ATM**: IF password correct, THEN allow access
- **Apps**: IF user clicks button, THEN perform action
- **Weather app**: IF temperature < 0, THEN show snow icon
- **Games**: IF health = 0, THEN game over

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, make sure you understand:
- Variables and data types
- Operators (especially comparison operators)
- Boolean values (True/False)

<Tip>
  Control flow is where programming gets fun! You'll start building programs that can actually make decisions and respond to different situations.
</Tip>

## Let's begin!

Start with the foundation of all program logic: if statements.
