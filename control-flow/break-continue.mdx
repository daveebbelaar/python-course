## Controlling loops

Sometimes you need to exit a loop early or skip certain iterations. Python provides `break` and `continue` for this.

- **break**: Exit the loop completely
- **continue**: Skip to the next iteration

## Break statement

Use `break` to exit a loop immediately:

```python
# Find first even number
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10]

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"Found even number: {num}")
        break  # Exit loop
    print(f"Checking {num}")

# Output:
# Checking 1
# Checking 3
# Checking 5
# Found even number: 8
```

### Common uses for break

```python
# Search and stop
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
search_name = "Bob"

for name in names:
    if name == search_name:
        print(f"Found {search_name}!")
        break
else:
    print(f"{search_name} not found")
```

<Note>
  The `else` clause on a loop runs only if the loop completes normally (without a break).
</Note>

## Continue statement

Use `continue` to skip the rest of the current iteration:

```python
# Print only positive numbers
numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    if num < 0:
        continue  # Skip negative numbers
    print(num)

# Output: 1, 3, 5
```

### Common uses for continue

```python
# Process valid items only
data = ["apple", "", "banana", None, "orange"]

for item in data:
    if not item:  # Skip empty or None
        continue
    print(f"Processing: {item}")

# Output:
# Processing: apple
# Processing: banana
# Processing: orange
```

## Break in while loops

```python
# User input loop
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter 'quit' to exit: ")
    
    if user_input == "quit":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    
    print(f"You said: {user_input}")
```

## Continue in while loops

```python
count = 0

while count < 10:
    count += 1
    
    if count % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    
    print(count)

# Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

## Nested loops

Break and continue only affect the innermost loop:

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(f"Outer loop: {i}")
    
    for j in range(3):
        if j == 1:
            break  # Only breaks inner loop
        print(f"  Inner loop: {j}")

# Output shows outer loop continues
```

## Common patterns

### Find first match
```python
def find_first_negative(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        if num < 0:
            return num  # Found it!
    return None  # Not found

result = find_first_negative([5, 3, -2, 8])
print(result)  # -2
```

### Skip invalid data
```python
scores = [85, -1, 92, 0, 78, -1]

total = 0
count = 0

for score in scores:
    if score < 0:  # -1 means invalid
        continue
    total += score
    count += 1

average = total / count if count > 0 else 0
print(f"Average: {average}")
```

  <Accordion title="Using break in nested loops">
    ```python
    # Wrong - thinking break exits all loops
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if j == 1:
                break  # Only exits inner loop!
        print(f"Still in outer loop: {i}")
    
    # Right - use a flag or return
    found = False
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if j == 1:
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Continue without incrementing">
    ```python
    # Wrong - infinite loop with continue
    count = 0
    while count < 5:
        if count == 3:
            continue  # Skips count += 1!
        print(count)
        count += 1
    
    # Right - increment before continue
    count = 0
    while count < 5:
        count += 1
        if count == 3:
            continue
        print(count)
    ```
