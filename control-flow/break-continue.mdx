## What are break and continue?

Sometimes you need more control over your loops:
- **break**: Exit the loop completely ("I'm done!")
- **continue**: Skip to the next iteration ("Skip this one!")

Think of it like watching TV:
- **break**: Turn off the TV and do something else
- **continue**: Skip this commercial, keep watching

## Break statement

`break` immediately exits the loop:

```python
# Find the first even number
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 2, 7, 9, 4]

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"Found even number: {num}")
        break  # Stop looking
    print(f"Checking {num}...")

print("Done searching")
```

Output:
```
Checking 1...
Checking 3...
Checking 5...
Found even number: 2
Done searching
```

### Common uses for break

```python
# 1. Search and stop
users = ["alice", "bob", "admin", "charlie"]
for user in users:
    if user == "admin":
        print("Admin found!")
        break

# 2. User wants to quit
while True:
    command = input("Enter command (quit to exit): ")
    if command == "quit":
        break
    print(f"Processing: {command}")

# 3. Limit iterations
count = 0
while True:
    count += 1
    print(count)
    if count >= 5:
        break  # Prevent infinite loop
```

## Continue statement

`continue` skips the rest of the current iteration:

```python
# Print only positive numbers
numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    if num < 0:
        continue  # Skip negative numbers
    print(num)
```

Output:
```
1
3
5
```

### Common uses for continue

```python
# 1. Skip invalid data
ages = [25, -5, 30, 999, 18]
for age in ages:
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        continue  # Skip unrealistic ages
    print(f"Processing age: {age}")

# 2. Skip empty items
names = ["Alice", "", "Bob", "  ", "Charlie"]
for name in names:
    if not name.strip():  # Skip empty/whitespace
        continue
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# 3. Filter during processing
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:  # Skip even numbers
        continue
    print(f"{i} squared is {i**2}")
```

## Break and continue in nested loops

In nested loops, break and continue only affect the innermost loop:

```python
# Multiplication table with limits
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"\nTable of {i}:")
    for j in range(1, 11):
        result = i * j
        if result > 20:
            break  # Only breaks inner loop
        print(f"{i} Ã— {j} = {result}")
```

## Break with else

Python has a unique feature - `else` with loops:

```python
# Search with else
search_for = 7
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 9, 11]

for num in numbers:
    if num == search_for:
        print(f"Found {search_for}!")
        break
else:
    # Runs only if loop completes without break
    print(f"{search_for} not found")
```

## Try it yourself

Create `password_checker.py`:

```python
# Password validation system
max_attempts = 3
correct_password = "python123"

print("SECURE SYSTEM LOGIN")
print("=" * 20)

for attempt in range(1, max_attempts + 1):
    password = input(f"Enter password (attempt {attempt}/{max_attempts}): ")
    
    # Check for quit command
    if password.lower() == "quit":
        print("Exiting system...")
        break
    
    # Skip empty passwords
    if not password:
        print("Password cannot be empty!")
        continue
    
    # Check password
    if password == correct_password:
        print("Access granted!")
        break
    else:
        print("Incorrect password!")
        
        # Check if last attempt
        if attempt == max_attempts:
            print("Maximum attempts reached. Access denied.")
else:
    # This runs if they quit or succeed
    # (break was used)
    pass

print("\nThank you for using our system.")
```

### Challenges

1. Create a number guessing game that uses break when correct
2. Process a list of scores, skip negative ones with continue
3. Build a menu system that breaks when user selects "exit"

## Common patterns

### Infinite loop with break
```python
# Menu system
while True:
    print("\n1. Play")
    print("2. Settings")
    print("3. Quit")
    
    choice = input("Select: ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        print("Playing...")
    elif choice == "2":
        print("Settings...")
    elif choice == "3":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice!")
```

### Skip processing with continue
```python
# Process only valid files
files = ["data.txt", "image.jpg", "script.py", ".hidden", ""]

for file in files:
    # Skip hidden files and empty names
    if not file or file.startswith("."):
        continue
    
    print(f"Processing: {file}")
```

### Early exit optimization
```python
# Stop when condition met
def has_negative(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        if num < 0:
            return True  # Found one, stop looking
    return False

# Alternative with break
found_negative = False
for num in numbers:
    if num < 0:
        found_negative = True
        break
```

## Common mistakes

### Break in wrong place
```python
# Wrong: break outside loop
if condition:
    break  # Error! No loop to break from

# Right: break inside loop
for item in items:
    if condition:
        break
```

### Forgetting continue skips code
```python
# Unexpected behavior
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
    # This never runs when i == 2
    print(f"{i} squared is {i**2}")
```

## Best practices

1. **Use break to prevent unnecessary work**
   ```python
   # Stop searching once found
   for item in huge_list:
       if item == target:
           process(item)
           break  # Don't check rest
   ```

2. **Use continue to keep code clean**
   ```python
   # Instead of deep nesting
   for item in items:
       if not is_valid(item):
           continue
       # Process valid items
       process(item)
   ```

3. **Document why you're breaking**
   ```python
   for attempt in attempts:
       if success:
           break  # Found solution, stop trying
   ```
