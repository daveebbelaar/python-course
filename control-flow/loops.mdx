## What are loops?

Loops let you repeat code multiple times. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you write it once in a loop.

Without loops:
```python
print("Hello 1")
print("Hello 2")
print("Hello 3")
print("Hello 4")
print("Hello 5")
```

With loops:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Hello {i + 1}")
```

## For loops

The most common loop in Python. Perfect for iterating through lists, strings, and other sequences.

### Loop through lists
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# Output:
# I like apple
# I like banana
# I like orange
```

### Loop through strings
```python
word = "Python"

for letter in word:
    print(letter)

# Output: P y t h o n (each on new line)
```

### Using range()
```python
# Count from 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Count from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)  # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# Count by 2s
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
```

<Note>
  `range(5)` creates numbers 0 through 4 (not including 5). This is a common source of confusion!
</Note>

## While loops

Repeat code while a condition is true:

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is {count}")
    count += 1  # Don't forget this!

# Output: Count is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

<Warning>
  Always ensure your while loop condition will eventually become False, or you'll create an infinite loop!
</Warning>

## Loop with index

Sometimes you need both the item and its position:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Using enumerate()
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")

# Output:
# 0: apple
# 1: banana
# 2: orange
```

## Nested loops

Loops inside loops:

```python
# Multiplication table
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i * j}")

# Output:
# 1 x 1 = 1
# 1 x 2 = 2
# ... and so on
```

## Common patterns

### Sum values
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = 0

for num in numbers:
    total += num

print(f"Total: {total}")  # Total: 150
```

### Find items
```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
search = "Bob"

for name in names:
    if name == search:
        print(f"Found {search}!")
        break  # Stop searching
```

### Build new lists
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = []

for num in numbers:
    doubled.append(num * 2)

print(doubled)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

  <Accordion title="Modifying list while looping">
    ```python
    # Wrong - modifying list during iteration
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            numbers.remove(num)  # Don't do this!
    
    # Right - create new list
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    odd_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            odd_numbers.append(num)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Infinite while loops">
    ```python
    # Wrong - forgot to update condition
    count = 0
    while count < 5:
        print(count)
        # Forgot count += 1
    
    # Right - always update the condition
    count = 0
    while count < 5:
        print(count)
        count += 1
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Off-by-one errors">
    ```python
    # Wrong - misunderstanding range
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Item {i + 1}")  # Trying to count 1-5
    
    # Right - adjust range directly
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(f"Item {i}")
    ```
