## What are loops?

Loops let you repeat code multiple times. Instead of writing the same thing over and over, you write it once and let Python repeat it.

Real-life loops:
- Washing dishes (repeat until all clean)
- Counting to 10 (repeat 10 times)
- Reading pages in a book (repeat for each page)
- Checking messages (repeat while new messages exist)

## For loops

Use `for` loops when you know how many times to repeat:

```python
# Print "Hello" 5 times
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello")

# Count from 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Count from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)  # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

<Note>
  `range(5)` creates numbers 0,1,2,3,4 (stops BEFORE 5)
</Note>

## Looping through collections

For loops work great with lists, strings, and more:

```python
# Loop through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# Loop through a string
for letter in "Python":
    print(letter)

# Loop through with index
for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{i}: {fruit}")  # 0: apple, 1: banana, etc.
```

## While loops

Use `while` loops when you don't know how many times to repeat:

```python
# Count down
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(f"Countdown: {count}")
    count -= 1  # Same as count = count - 1
print("Blast off! ðŸš€")

# Keep asking until valid input
password = ""
while password != "secret":
    password = input("Enter password: ")
print("Access granted!")
```

<Warning>
  Be careful! Forgetting to update the condition creates an infinite loop.
</Warning>

## Range in detail

The `range()` function is powerful:

```python
# range(stop) - from 0 to stop-1
for i in range(3):
    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2

# range(start, stop) - from start to stop-1
for i in range(2, 5):
    print(i)  # 2, 3, 4

# range(start, stop, step) - with custom step
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

# Count backwards
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)  # 10, 9, 8, ..., 1
```

## Nested loops

Loops inside loops:

```python
# Multiplication table
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        result = i * j
        print(f"{i} Ã— {j} = {result}")
    print()  # Empty line between tables

# Pattern printing
for i in range(5):
    for j in range(i + 1):
        print("*", end="")
    print()  # New line
# Output:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
```

## Loop with else

Python's unique feature - else with loops:

```python
# Runs if loop completes normally
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished normally")

# Doesn't run if break is used
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("This won't print")  # Because we used break
```

## Common loop patterns

### Accumulation
```python
# Sum numbers
total = 0
for num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    total += num
print(f"Total: {total}")  # 15

# Build a string
result = ""
for letter in "hello":
    result += letter.upper()
print(result)  # HELLO
```

### Filtering
```python
# Find even numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
evens = []
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        evens.append(num)
print(evens)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### Finding
```python
# Find first negative
numbers = [5, 3, -2, 8, -1, 4]
for num in numbers:
    if num < 0:
        print(f"First negative: {num}")
        break
```

## Try it yourself

Create `number_game.py`:

```python
import random

# Number Guessing Game
print("NUMBER GUESSING GAME")
print("=" * 30)
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100")
print("You have 7 tries to guess it!\n")

# Generate random number
secret = random.randint(1, 100)
max_tries = 7

# Game loop
for attempt in range(1, max_tries + 1):
    # Get guess
    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input(f"Attempt {attempt}/{max_tries} - Your guess: "))
            if 1 <= guess <= 100:
                break
            else:
                print("Please guess between 1 and 100")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a number")
    
    # Check guess
    if guess == secret:
        print(f"\nðŸŽ‰ CORRECT! You got it in {attempt} tries!")
        break
    elif guess < secret:
        print("Too low! Try higher.")
    else:
        print("Too high! Try lower.")
    
    # Give hints
    if attempt == 3:
        if secret % 2 == 0:
            print("Hint: It's an even number")
        else:
            print("Hint: It's an odd number")
    
    if attempt == 5:
        print(f"Hint: It's between {secret - 10} and {secret + 10}")
    
else:
    # Only runs if loop completes (no break)
    print(f"\nðŸ˜¢ Sorry! The number was {secret}")

# Play again?
print("\nGame Statistics:")
print(f"Secret number: {secret}")
print(f"Your guesses: {attempt}")
```

### Challenges

1. Create a multiplication practice program
2. Build a todo list that loops until user quits
3. Make a pattern printer (triangles, squares, diamonds)

## Infinite loops

Sometimes you want loops that run forever:

```python
# Menu system
while True:
    print("\n--- MENU ---")
    print("1. Play")
    print("2. Settings") 
    print("3. Quit")
    
    choice = input("Select: ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        print("Playing game...")
    elif choice == "2":
        print("Opening settings...")
    elif choice == "3":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break  # Exit the infinite loop
    else:
        print("Invalid choice")
```

## List comprehensions (preview)

A Pythonic way to create lists with loops:

```python
# Traditional way
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i ** 2)

# List comprehension (same result)
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(10)]

# With condition
evens = [i for i in range(20) if i % 2 == 0]
```

## Common mistakes

### Infinite while loops
```python
# Wrong - count never changes
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)  # Prints 5 forever!

# Right
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1  # Update the condition
```

### Off-by-one errors
```python
# Wrong - misses last item
items = ["a", "b", "c"]
for i in range(len(items) - 1):  # Only 0, 1
    print(items[i])  # Misses "c"

# Right
for i in range(len(items)):  # 0, 1, 2
    print(items[i])

# Even better
for item in items:
    print(item)
```

### Modifying list while looping
```python
# Dangerous
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        numbers.remove(num)  # Can skip items!

# Safe - loop over copy
for num in numbers.copy():
    if num % 2 == 0:
        numbers.remove(num)
```

## Performance tips

1. **Use the right loop**
   ```python
   # For known iterations
   for i in range(100):
       process(i)
   
   # For conditions
   while not done:
       work()
   ```

2. **Avoid unnecessary work**
   ```python
   # Bad - len() called every time
   for i in range(len(big_list)):
   
   # Good - calculated once
   list_length = len(big_list)
   for i in range(list_length):
   ```

3. **Use enumerate for indices**
   ```python
   # Instead of
   for i in range(len(items)):
       print(i, items[i])
   
   # Use
   for i, item in enumerate(items):
       print(i, item)
   ```
