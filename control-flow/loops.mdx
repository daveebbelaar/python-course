## What are loops?

Loops let you repeat code multiple times. Instead of writing the same thing over and over, you write it once and let Python repeat it.

Real-life loops:
- Washing dishes (repeat until all clean)
- Counting steps (repeat 10,000 times)
- Reading emails (repeat for each message)

## For loops

Use `for` loops when you know how many times to repeat:

```python
# Repeat 5 times
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello")

# Count from 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Count from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)  # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

<Note>
  `range(5)` creates numbers 0,1,2,3,4 (stops BEFORE 5). This often confuses beginners!
</Note>

## Looping through collections

For loops work with lists, strings, and more:

```python
# Loop through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# Loop through a string
for letter in "Python":
    print(letter)

# Loop with index
for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{i}: {fruit}")  # 0: apple, 1: banana...
```

## While loops

Use `while` loops when you don't know how many times to repeat:

```python
# Count down
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(f"Countdown: {count}")
    count -= 1  # Same as count = count - 1
print("Blast off! ðŸš€")

# Keep asking until valid
password = ""
while password != "secret":
    password = input("Enter password: ")
print("Access granted!")
```

<Warning>
  Always update the condition variable inside a while loop, or it will run forever!
</Warning>

## Common patterns

### Accumulation
```python
# Sum numbers
total = 0
for num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    total += num
print(f"Total: {total}")  # 15
```

### Filtering
```python
# Find even numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = []
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        evens.append(num)
print(evens)  # [2, 4, 6]
```

  <Accordion title="Off-by-one errors">
    ```python
    # Wrong - prints 0 to 9
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
    
    # Right - prints 1 to 10
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i)
    ```

  <Accordion title="Infinite while loops">
    ```python
    # Wrong - infinite loop!
    count = 5
    while count > 0:
        print(count)
        # Forgot to decrease count!
    
    # Right
    count = 5
    while count > 0:
        print(count)
        count -= 1
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Modifying list while looping">
    ```python
    # Wrong - causes problems
    items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for item in items:
        if item == 3:
            items.remove(item)
    
    # Right - use a copy
    items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for item in items[:]:  # [:] makes a copy
        if item == 3:
            items.remove(item)
    ```
