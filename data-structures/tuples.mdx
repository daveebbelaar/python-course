## What are tuples?

Tuples are like lists, but they can't be changed once created. They're immutable (unchangeable) sequences.

Use tuples for data that shouldn't change:
- Coordinates (x, y)
- RGB colors (255, 0, 0)
- Database records
- Function return values

## Creating tuples

```python
# Empty tuple
empty = ()

# Tuple with items
point = (3, 5)
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")

# Single item tuple needs comma!
single = (42,)  # Note the comma
not_tuple = (42)  # This is just 42 in parentheses

# Without parentheses (implicit)
coordinates = 10, 20
```

<Warning>
  A single-item tuple needs a comma: `(42,)` not `(42)`. Without the comma, Python thinks it's just parentheses around a number!
</Warning>

## Accessing items

Just like lists, tuples use indexing:

```python
point = (3, 5)
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")

# Get items
print(point[0])      # 3
print(colors[-1])    # "blue"

# Slicing works too
print(colors[0:2])   # ("red", "green")
```

## Tuple unpacking

Python's coolest tuple feature:

```python
# Unpack values
point = (3, 5)
x, y = point  # x = 3, y = 5

# Multiple assignment
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3  # Same as (1, 2, 3)

# Swap variables elegantly
x, y = y, x  # Swaps values!
```

## Common mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Forgetting comma in single tuple">
    ```python
    # Wrong - not a tuple
    single = (42)
    print(type(single))  # <class 'int'>
    
    # Right - include comma
    single = (42,)
    print(type(single))  # <class 'tuple'>
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Trying to modify tuples">
    ```python
    # Wrong - tuples are immutable
    point = (3, 5)
    point[0] = 4  # TypeError!
    
    # Right - create a new tuple
    point = (4, point[1])
    # Or convert to list, modify, convert back
    temp = list(point)
    temp[0] = 4
    point = tuple(temp)
    ```
  </Accordion>

Finally, let's explore sets - collections of unique items!
