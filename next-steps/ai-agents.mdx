## Build AI agents in Python

Now that you have a solid Python foundation, you're ready to build real AI applications. The natural next step is learning to create AI agents that can take actions and solve problems.

Our recommended follow-up course covers everything you need to build practical AI agents using Python:

## What you'll learn

The AI agents course builds directly on the Python skills you've learned here:

- Understand how to work directly with LLM APIs (like OpenAI).
- Learn to structure AI workflows using proven patterns.
- Use structured outputs to make AI responses programmatically useful.
- Implement tool use, memory, and retrieval which are the foundations for modern AI agents.
- Build a working AI agent in pure Python, setting the stage for more complex systems later.

You already have the Python knowledge needed to succeed in building AI agents. This course will show you how to apply it.
